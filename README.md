Core Idea: You are a space pilot in the middle of an asteroid belt being pelted by nonstop asteroids and baddies. Your ship has limited fuel that must be recharged in StarPortals that appear ahead of you scattered in the middle of the asteroid barrage. The bad guys are on your six! Fire your blaster, avoid being crushed by the crazy amount of space rocks your heading into. Can you make it home in one piece?
